${{ content_synopsis }} This image will run a [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) sftp server based on openssh. Unlike other images, this image does not provide chroot jails, but it's intended to run as a single user with all the shares needed mounted in ```/home/%u```. Use an SSH proxy in front of this image when you need to expose multiple endpoints via a single entry point. The imageâ€™s entrypoint does quickly elevate to root to change the username and drops instantly back down to 1000 for the ssh server. If no **ssh_host_key** secret is set, the image will create a new one on each start of the container.
